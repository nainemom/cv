        <h3>Front-end</h3>
        <p>
            I mostly works as frontend developer. I deeped into <b>Javascript</b> plus frameworks such as <b>Vue (advanced)</b>, <b>Nuxt (advanced)</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Angular-1.x</b> and also basics of <b>Typescript</b>. In styling part I can work with plain <b>CSS</b>, <b>SCSS</b>, and/or popular frameworks like <b>Bootstrap</b>. In markup section I should put <b>Pug</b> and <b>HTML</b>. I understand how a web-project works, so I just put some other tools that I couldn't find a section to write:
            <b>Webpack</b>, <b>CSS-Modules</b>, <b>Grunt</b>, <b>Gulp</b>, <b>Electron</b>, <b>Cordova</b>, and more.

        <h3>Server-Side</h3>
        <p>

I can write a server-side code with <b>NodeJS</b>, connecting to DBs like <b>MySQL</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> and finnaly manage images/containers/services via <b>Docker</b> and <b>Kubernetees</b>.
